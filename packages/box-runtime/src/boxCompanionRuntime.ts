 * peer-to-peer traffic, and it is the stream the panel can actually show.
 *
 * VNC is not merely asked first, it is preferred for the whole budget: a read with no URL in it is
 * a stream Box has not finished bringing up, whether or not that read also says `provisioning`, so
 * it is polled rather than read as a Box with no VNC. Production proved why the flag alone cannot
 * decide it — a first join was handed WebRTC, whose URL arrives at once and then never becomes a
 * picture, while the reconnect a moment later got the VNC stream that had been coming all along.
 *
 * WebRTC is what a mint settles for, never what it prefers, so it is asked exactly twice over: once
 * when the provider refuses `?vnc=1` outright, because a build that does not know the flag must not
 * take computer use down with it, and once when the budget runs out with no VNC URL to show for it.
 * A URL it returns before either of those has happened is a URL this mint never asked for.
 *
 * This is a decision about two answers and a clock rather than about Box itself, so the calls, the
 * poll interval, and the budget are all handed in: the arithmetic has to hold for a stream that
 * arrives at once, one that arrives late, one that never arrives, and a flag the provider refuses.
