# Companion

This skill lets you manage the skills on this machine and keep them in sync with a Companion
workspace: validate a skill, publish it, push an update, and check whether everything is current.
You always confirm a change with the user before anything is published.

## Configuration

You need two values, supplied when this skill is installed (or set them in the environment):

- `COMPANION_API_URL` — the workspace API base, e.g. `https://companion.acme.dev/v1`.
- `COMPANION_TOKEN` — a personal access token (`cmp_pat_…`) scoped to `skills:read` and
  `skills:write`. Send it as `Authorization: Bearer $COMPANION_TOKEN`.

Never print the token back to the user or write it into a skill package. Treat skill files as the
only thing you read; do not scan the rest of the machine.

A skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` at its root. Companion records two values under
`metadata` in that file:

- `companion_skill_id` — the workspace id of the published skill (added on first publish).
- `companion_version` — the version this folder corresponds to.

These let you tell, offline, which workspace skill a folder maps to and whether it is behind.

## Capabilities

### Manage your skills

Work from the skill folders on this machine: each is a directory with a `SKILL.md` at its root. List
those folders and read each one's frontmatter `metadata` (`companion_skill_id`, `companion_version`)
to know which workspace skill it maps to and which version it is at. This inventory is local and
needs no network call — your token is for publishing and version checks, not for browsing the whole
workspace catalog (that listing is session-only in the web app).

### Validate a skill

Always validate before you publish. The server runs the same checks without writing anything:

```sh
cd <skill-folder> && zip -r -q ../skill.zip . \
  && curl -s "$COMPANION_API_URL/skills?action=validate" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer $COMPANION_TOKEN" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/zip" \
       --data-binary @../skill.zip
```

Report the checklist back to the user. If any check fails, fix it and re-validate; do not publish.

### Publish a skill

After a clean validation, and after the user confirms, publish a brand-new skill:

```sh
curl -s "$COMPANION_API_URL/skills?everyone=false" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $COMPANION_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/zip" \
  --data-binary @../skill.zip
```

The response contains the assigned `id`, `version`, and `checksum`. Write the returned
`companion_skill_id` and `companion_version` back into the folder's `SKILL.md` `metadata` so the
folder stays linked to the workspace skill.

### Update a skill

When the user changed a skill that already exists in the workspace, bind the upload to that exact
skill so an edit can never retarget another one. Pass `expect_slug` and `expect_skill_id` (read them
from the folder's `metadata`):

```sh
curl -s "$COMPANION_API_URL/skills?expect_slug=$SLUG&expect_skill_id=$SKILL_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $COMPANION_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/zip" \
  --data-binary @../skill.zip
```

The server assigns the next version unless you pass an explicit `version=`. Summarize what changed
and confirm before sending.

### Check for updates

For each skill folder that has a `metadata.companion_skill_id`, read its `metadata.companion_version`,
then ask the workspace for the current published version of that slug:

```sh
curl -s "$COMPANION_API_URL/skills/$SLUG/download" -H "Authorization: Bearer $COMPANION_TOKEN"
```

The response includes the current `version` and `checksum`. If that `version` is greater than the
folder's `companion_version`, the folder is **out of date**. Present a short, plain list: up to date,
out of date, or not published yet (a `404` means the slug is not in this workspace).

### Install updates

For an out-of-date folder, take the current `version` from the `download` response above, fetch that
version's package, and replace the files in place (after the user confirms):

```sh
curl -sL "$COMPANION_API_URL/skills/$SLUG/versions/$VERSION/package" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $COMPANION_TOKEN" -o update.zip
```

Unzip it over the folder, then confirm `SKILL.md` sits at the package root and its
`metadata.companion_version` matches the version you fetched. (Companion's `checksum` is a hash of
the canonical tar, not of this repackaged zip, so use it as a version identity reference, not a
byte hash of `update.zip`.)

## Confirm installation (run once, at the end of install)

The last step of installing **this** skill is to tell the workspace it is present, so the Companion
skills view shows the correct status and version. Report the version from this file's
`metadata.companion_version`:

```sh
curl -s "$COMPANION_API_URL/local-skills/companion/installed" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $COMPANION_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"version":"1.0.0","agent":"<your assistant name>"}'
```

A `{ "ok": true, "status": "installed" }` response confirms the workspace now knows this machine has
the Companion skill. Run this again after you install an update so the reported version stays
current.

See `reference/api.md` for the full endpoint list.
