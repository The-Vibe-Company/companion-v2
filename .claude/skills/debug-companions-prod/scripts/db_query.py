"""Named read-only PostgreSQL queries against the production Companion database.

Safety model:

- every invocation is wrapped in ``BEGIN TRANSACTION READ ONLY; ...; ROLLBACK;``;
- there is NO free-SQL mode — only the named queries below exist;
- ids and windows are passed as psql ``-v`` variables and interpolated with
  ``:'name'`` quoting (never Python string interpolation into SQL);
- the connection URL is handed to psql via the environment (libpq expands a
  conninfo-shaped ``PGDATABASE``), never via argv.

Every table and column below is verified against packages/db/src/schema.ts.
