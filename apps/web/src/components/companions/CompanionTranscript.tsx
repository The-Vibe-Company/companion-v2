 * The conversation of one Companion, rendered through assistant-ui.

 * parts — and nothing else: the messages come from the control-plane read model this component is
 * handed, sending goes back out through the same callback the rest of Companions uses, and no
 * assistant-ui thread list, cloud, history, or model adapter is wired up. A Viewer gets the
 * transcript with a read-only note where the composer would be, and the runtime has nothing to
 * contact, so reading a thread still cannot reach Box.
 *
 * A Pi turn arrives here as one message whose parts are its reasoning, its reply, and every tool run
 * and permission card it produced. The two cards are registered as tool UIs by name, which is how a
 * permission decision — the one thing in this thread a reader can act on — reaches the control plane
 * from inside a message part.
